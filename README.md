# DetectingPedrestrians

Python implementation for automatic detection of people in images using different descriptors and its optimized linear SVM as classifier

## Prerequisites

It is needed to previously install:

* [OpenCV 3](https://github.com/opencv/opencv) with Python 3 bindings
* [Scikit-learn](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn)
* [Numpy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy)

## Introduction

This repo contains a pedestrian detector on images by training a optimized linear SVM by using either OpenCV descriptors (HOG) or self-implemented descriptor (LBP, ULBP).

## About modules

Some are applied for train the classifier over a set of images of training and test and looks for the optimized SVM parameters:

* `LBP_Basic.py` -- using the features from the self-implemented LBP 
* `LBP_Unif.py` -- using the features from the self-implemented Uniform-LBP
* `HOG.py` -- using the features from the OpenCV HOG
* `HOG_LBP.py` -- using a combination of the features from the OpenCV HOG and the self-implemented LBP

In other hand, the `Sweeper.py` module is used to search for the pedestrians in some desired image by using a defined sliding window on the image at different sizes.

In order to obtain a proper performance it might be needed to set an appropriate scale factor.


## Notes

In ProjectDocumentation.pdf you will find an explanation of the project and the results obtained (in Spanish).

The pickle files used in `Sweeper.py` are currently not available in this repo, even though they can be generated by the other modules
